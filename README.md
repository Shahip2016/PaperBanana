# PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists

PaperBanana is a sophisticated agentic framework designed to automate the creation of publication-ready academic illustrations. It orchestrates a team of specialized AI agents to transform raw scientific concepts into professional-grade diagrams, plots, and figures.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system follows a five-agent collaborative workflow:

1.  **Retriever**: Extracts core scientific concepts and entities from input documents.
2.  **Planner**: Develops a structured structural plan for the illustration.
3.  **Stylist**: Defines the visual aesthetics, ensuring thematic consistency.
4.  **Visualizer**: Renders the final illustration using SVG and Canvas technologies.
5.  **Critic**: Reviews the output for scientific accuracy and aesthetic quality.
